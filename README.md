# Double-Edged Sort: A Double Sort/Iteration Algorithm
 
A pretty fast sorting algorithm I created, that will take a custom list of integers to work on as the input (either in the form of manual integer entry or supplying a dictionary/list file) and generate a sorted list with all the integers in either ascending or descending order, depending on the user's selection. It supports both — odd and even number of entries, and even duplicate entries — flawlessly. Upon completion, the initial input list is destroyed and only the final sorted list prevails. The algorithm is considered fast due to both the min() and max() functions residing in a single iteration itself, filling the sorted array two integers per iteration instead of the rather conventional/traditional one integer per iteration approach. This project was created in Python, and can be tested using my own [NumNinja](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/NumNinja-Number-Dictionary-Generator) and/or [R.NumNinja](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/RNumNinja-Random-Number-File-Generator) which can help create massive numbered list files within user specified constraints, respectively either in ascending order or randomized order.
